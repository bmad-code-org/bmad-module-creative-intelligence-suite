# Release Runbook — cis-skills Mirror

How to cut a versioned release of `bmad-code-org/cis-skills`, the distribution
mirror for the CIS module. Follow it top to bottom on a local clone of that
repository; it needs no other document.

## Prerequisites

- Push access to `git@github.com:bmad-code-org/cis-skills.git` over SSH.
- `uv`, or plain Python >= 3.11 — the stamper uses only the standard library,
  so `python3 tools/stamp_release.py <version>` works wherever the `uv run`
  command below appears.

## Branch model

- `dev` is the development branch. It is force-pushed from the source repo
  (`bmad-module-creative-intelligence-suite`) and always carries the
  placeholder version (for example `0.3.1-next`). It is never stamped.
- `main` is the default branch and is release-only. Installed copies check for
  updates against `main`, so what `main` serves defines the released version.
- Every release rewrites `main`: `main` is always the current `dev` plus
  exactly one stamp commit. It is never a fast-forward of the previous
  release, which is why the push below force-pushes.

Refresh `dev` from the source repo with:

```bash
git push --force git@github.com:bmad-code-org/cis-skills.git <source-branch>:dev
```

## 1. Prepare a clean checkout of dev

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bmad-code-org/cis-skills.git   # or reuse an existing clone
cd cis-skills
git status --porcelain        # must print nothing; stop and clean up if it does
git fetch origin
git checkout --detach origin/dev
```

Working detached keeps the stamp commit off the local `dev` branch — `dev`
stays unstamped everywhere.

## 2. Choose the version

You supply the version; the tooling never derives or increments it. It must:

- be SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, optional prerelease such as `-rc.1`),
- not contain `-dev` (the update check cannot order `-dev` versions, so
  installed copies would never learn they are current or outdated),
- carry no build metadata (`+...`) — the update check drops it, so
  `0.3.1+hotfix` compares equal to `0.3.1` and installed copies would never
  see such a release,
- differ from the version `main` currently serves — stamping the same version
  again is a no-op for installed copies, so a release must change it. Change
  the major, minor, patch, or prerelease part.

The stamper enforces the first three and refuses to write anything if one
fails. The last is yours to check — it cannot know what `main` serves.

CIS versions independently of BMad Method — `update_source` is per-manifest,
so the two modules never share a release cadence. Pick from CIS's own version
line, not BMM's. While the mirror is a testing mirror, rehearse with
`0.0.0-next.N` and never reuse an N.

Check what `main` serves now:

```bash
git show origin/main:skills/bmad-cis-design-thinking/module-manifest.toml
```

## 3. Stamp

```bash
uv run --python 3.11 tools/stamp_release.py <version>
```

Expected: exit 0 and a summary listing every `skills/*/module-manifest.toml`.
The stamper also validates every manifest before writing: exact manifest
keys, a known module, and the one known update source and knowledge pointer.
If it exits nonzero, the tree may be left half-stamped (the script writes the
files before its final verification), so restore it with `git checkout -- .`
first, then fix the reported problem and rerun.

## 4. Review the diff

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Expected: only the files from the stamp summary, and within each file only the
version value changed.

## 5. Commit, tag, and push to main

```bash
git commit -am "chore(release): v<version>"
git tag "v<version>"
git push --atomic --force-with-lease origin HEAD:main "refs/tags/v<version>"
```

The force push is expected on every release (see the branch model above).
`--force-with-lease` makes it fail if someone else moved `main` since your
fetch; if that happens, start over from step 1 (and delete the local tag
first: `git tag -d "v<version>"`).

The tag is what preserves history: force-pushing `main` orphans the previous
release commit, and the tag keeps it reachable — every past release stays
inspectable as `v<version>`. Tag pushes are never forced, so pushing a
version that was ever released before fails loudly; that is intentional.
Versions are never reused — pick a new one. `--atomic` makes `main` and the
tag land together or not at all.

## 6. Verify

```bash
git fetch origin
git show origin/main:skills/bmad-cis-design-thinking/module-manifest.toml   # version = "<version>"
git show origin/dev:skills/bmad-cis-design-thinking/module-manifest.toml    # still the placeholder
```

Note: installed copies check for updates through `raw.githubusercontent.com`,
which caches files for around five minutes. Right after the push, update
checks may still report the previous version; that is the CDN, not a failed
release. Verify through git (above), or wait a few minutes before trusting
an update check.

## 7. Confirm the release installs

```bash
npx skills add bmad-code-org/cis-skills --skill '*'
bmad update
```

Expected: the ten CIS skills install, and `bmad update` reports `cis` at the
version just released, separately from any other installed module.
