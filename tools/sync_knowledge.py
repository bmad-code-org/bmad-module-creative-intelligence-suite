"""Fan the shared bmad-meta/ files out into the skills that carry them.

A skill must be self-contained once installed, so every skill that names a
document ships its own copy. Editing 22 copies by hand is how they drift, so
bmad-meta/ at the repo root is the only copy anyone edits and this script
writes the rest.

Nothing here decides which skill gets which file: the manifest does. Any string
anywhere in a manifest that is a path under bmad-meta/ names a file the skill
carries, whatever key holds it, so a new kind of shared file needs no change
here. A shared document a skill no longer names is deleted,
so moving a skill between groups is one manifest edit and a sync.

Only documents that exist in bmad-meta/ are managed. A skill may carry a
document of its own that no other skill has, and anything else the skill puts
in bmad-meta/ is its own business — this script leaves both alone. That a
declared document actually exists is tools/validate_manifests.py's job.

Usage:
  uv run tools/sync_knowledge.py            # report drift, change nothing
  uv run tools/sync_knowledge.py --write    # make the copies match
